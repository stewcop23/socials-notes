|Before the arrival of the Europeans, the False Creek area was surrounded by a dense temperate rainforest of fir, hemlock, spruce and salal. Numerous salmon-bearing streams meandered through the trees, draining into the Pacific at False Creek. First Nations, including the Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh peoples, inhabited the area; evidence of early settlements on False Creek dates back 3, 000 years. The “creek” itself was five times its present size and its boundaries reached well into areas now filled and urbanized. The east end of the creek was a large tidal mud flat. The creek’s shallows supported a rich diversity of sea life: shellfish and crustaceans abounded while the waters off the tidal beach supported sole, perch and sturgeon. The rich ecosystem of the estuary attracted migratory birds, and the coniferous forest was home to bears, cougars, elk and deer. -- “The Challenger Series.” The Challenger Series: Millennium Water <http://www.thechallengeseries.ca/chapter-01/history>.

For one glorious summer, Vancouver, the dinky 'provincial' logging and mining finance city, had transformed an industrial waterfront wasteland into a splendid high-tech adventure-zone." Coppin, Rhiannon. “Vancouver Was Awesome: Expo '86 and False Creek.” Vancouver Is Awesome, 6 May 2011, 5:51 PM, www.vancouverisawesome.com/history/vancouver-was-awesome-expo-86-and-false-creek-1922909.   | The park offers something for everyone. The south end consists of two synthetic turf fields that are used for field hockey, soccer and ultimate, with a perimeter walking path. The fields are lit and are heavily used by the local community and for tournaments. The north end of the park consists of a playground, amphitheatre, lawn area, meadows, rain gardens, community plaza, covered multi-use park shelter and harvest bench. It is a venue for many neighbourhood events, and where art and environmental education can be demonstrated. Some areas of Trillium Park North (meadows, rain gardens) have been naturalized. This requires new approaches to design and maintenance. Naturalized areas are environmentally sustainable. They are not mowed, fertilized or irrigated and don't look like typical manicured parks. They include a diversity of plants, including native plants that provide habitat for bees and other pollinators, are used for producing weaving material, dyes and artwork, and create a learning environment for schoolchildren and the community. <https://covapp.vancouver.ca/ParkFinder/parkdetail.aspx?inparkid=245>

**Part 2- Analysis (3 Questions, 5 Themes, Continuity and Change)**

|                                                        | **Time Period #1**                                           | **Time Period #2**           |
| :----------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| **What is where?**                                     | Almost nothing is there. It is completely different from what we know today. The “creek” extends down to what is now Clark. |                              |
| **Why is it there?**                                   | Because of mother nature?                                    |                              |
| **Why care?**                                          | Because before all of the colonization and bad stuff happening it was a really nice place were many differing groups of people could live together in relative peace |                              |
|                                                        | **Time Period 1 to 2**                                       | **Time Period 2 to Present** |
| <p>**Continuity**</p><p>What has stayed the same? </p> | Very little.                                                 |                              |
| <p>**Change**</p><p>What has shifted?** </p>           | Almost everything. The majority of the area that we know today had been filled in by this point. Its use in Expo 86 really helped it to become a much better and brighter place. |                              |

**Part 3- Conclusions**

| **Prompt Question**                                  | <p>Using our case study as an example, how does geographic thinking give us insight into a place and what should happen to it over time? (3-5 minutes)</p><p>You should reference at least 2 components from  of the following: </p><p>- Views of Land</p><p>- Complete Neighbourhood Criteria </p><p>- Sense of Place</p> |
| :--------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Link to your File**                                |                                                              |
| **Confirm that you have checked the share settings** |                                                              |
