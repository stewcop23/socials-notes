[Chorus]  
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain  
[With the barkers and the colored balloons](https://genius.com/Neil-young-sugar-mountain-lyrics#note-16959146)  
[You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain  
Though you're thinking that  
You're leavin' there too soon](https://genius.com/Neil-young-sugar-mountain-lyrics#note-10194081)  
You're leavin' there too soon  

[Verse 1]  
It's so noisy at the fair  
But all your friends are there  
[And the candy floss you had](https://genius.com/Neil-young-sugar-mountain-lyrics#note-16959151)  
And your mother and your dad  

[Chorus]  
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain  
With the barkers and the colored balloons  
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain  
Though you're thinking that  
You're leavin' there too soon  
You're leavin' there too soon  
  
[Verse 2]  
[There's a girl just down the aisle  
Oh to turn and see her smile](https://genius.com/Neil-young-sugar-mountain-lyrics#note-11825719)  
[You can hear the words she wrote  
As you read the hidden note](https://genius.com/Neil-young-sugar-mountain-lyrics#note-16959160)  




[Chorus]  
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain  
With the barkers and the colored balloons  
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain  
Though you're thinking that  
You're leavin' there too soon  
You're leavin' there too soon  
  
[Verse 3]  
[Now you're underneath the stairs  
And you're giving back some glares  
To the people who you met  
And it's your first cigarette](https://genius.com/Neil-young-sugar-mountain-lyrics#note-11818406)  

[Chorus]  
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain  
With the barkers and the colored balloons  
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain  
Though you're thinking that  
You're leavin' there too soon  
You're leavin' there too soon  

[Verse 4]  
[Now you say you're leaving home  
Because you want to be alone  
Ain't it funny how you feel  
When you're findin' out it's real?](https://genius.com/Neil-young-sugar-mountain-lyrics#note-16959185)  



[Chorus]  
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain  
With the barkers and the colored balloons  
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain  
Though you're thinking that  
You're leavin' there too soon  
You're leavin' there too soon  
[Oh to live on Sugar Mountain  
With the barkers and the colored balloons  
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain  
Though you're thinking that  
You're leavin' there too soon](https://genius.com/Neil-young-sugar-mountain-lyrics#note-11825775)
