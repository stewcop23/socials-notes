[Chorus]  
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain  
[With the barkers and the colored balloons](https://genius.com/Neil-young-sugar-mountain-lyrics#note-16959146)  
[You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain  
Though you're thinking that  
You're leaving there too soon](https://genius.com/Neil-young-sugar-mountain-lyrics#note-10194081)  
You're leaving there too soon  

[Verse 1]  
It's so noisy at the fair  
But all your friends are there  
[And the candy floss you had](https://genius.com/Neil-young-sugar-mountain-lyrics#note-16959151)  
And your mother and your dad  

[Chorus]  
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain  
With the barkers and the colored balloons  
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain  
Though you're thinking that  
You're leaving there too soon  
You're leaving there too soon  
  
[Verse 2]  
[There's a girl just down the aisle  
Oh to turn and see her smile](https://genius.com/Neil-young-sugar-mountain-lyrics#note-11825719)  
[You can hear the words she wrote  
As you read the hidden note](https://genius.com/Neil-young-sugar-mountain-lyrics#note-16959160)  

[Chorus]  
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain  
With the barkers and the colored balloons  
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain  
Though you're thinking that  
You're leaving there too soon  
You're leaving there too soon  
  
[Verse 3]  
[Now you're underneath the stairs  
And you're giving back some glares  
To the people who you met  
And it's your first cigarette](https://genius.com/Neil-young-sugar-mountain-lyrics#note-11818406)  

[Chorus]  
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain  
With the barkers and the colored balloons  
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain  
Though you're thinking that  
You're leaving there too soon  
You're leaving there too soon  

[Verse 4]  
[Now you say you're leaving home  
Because you want to be alone  
Ain't it funny how you feel  
When you're finding out it's real?](https://genius.com/Neil-young-sugar-mountain-lyrics#note-16959185)  

[Chorus]  
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain  
With the barkers and the colored balloons  
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain  
Though you're thinking that  
You're leaving there too soon  
You're leaving there too soon  
[Oh to live on Sugar Mountain  
With the barkers and the colored balloons  
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain  
Though you're thinking that  
You're leaving there too soon](https://genius.com/Neil-young-sugar-mountain-lyrics#note-11825775)

**What does it make you think about?**

This song makes me think that we all grow old. and we spend our youth in things that really have no meaning, said, quite literaly, in the line ``You're leaving there too soon``. and honestly this song makes me worried, that m freest days have already passed and ive become one with the cogs of society already.

**What does it make you feel?**

well as is obvious in the pervious answe, i am feeling a littlr bit existential about this whole thing. but as i will elaborate more later, i habe some very pleasent memories about this sone.

**What memory does it evoke?** / **What time or place does it take you to?**

Whenever I hear this song it always takes me back to a scene where I am in the back seat of our car (Silver Volkswagen Toureg) and we are back home down the highway from my uncles farm, and I am bout to fall asleep, I can hear the wheels against the asphalt and the world is just bliss.
